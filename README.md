# Ba+WAn (Baade+Wesselink Analysis software)

The code allows to perform the analysis with the Surface Brightness - Color Relation version of the Baade-Wesselink method for any radially pulsating star. It allows to determine the radius of the star and its distance (if the projection factor is known) or the projection factor (p-factor, if the distance is known).

The input data are: light curves in two photometric bands and radial velocity curve, color excess E(B-V), parallax or p-factor. 

# Requirements
1. Python 3
2. Numpy
3. Scipy
4. Matplotlib
5. PyQt5
6. Imageio

# Installation

Download the code (uncompress the archive if needed) and go to the directory '''balwan''' and simply run '''python balwan.py'''. You can add '''balwan''' directory to your path and make executable of '''python.py''' with '''chmod +x balwan.py'''. Then you will be able to runn the code from any directory.
