# Ba+WAn (Baade+Wesselink Analysis software)

The code allows to perform the Surface Brightness - Color Relation version of the Baade-Wesselink method for any radially pulsating star. It allows to determine the radius of the star and its distance (if the projection factor is known) or the projection factor (p-factor, if the distance is known).

The input data are: light curves in two photometric bands and radial velocity curve, color excess E(B-V), parallax or p-factor.
